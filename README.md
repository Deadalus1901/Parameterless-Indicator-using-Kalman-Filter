# Parameterless-Indicator-using-Kalman-Filter

This is a script for creating a parameterless indicator using a Kalman filter, a popular algorithm for predicting future values of a time series based on historical data.<br> The Kalman filter is a powerful tool for analyzing time series data, as it can be used to estimate unknown variables based on noisy or incomplete observations.
